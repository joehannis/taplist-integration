#### Build Instructions

##### Required

You will need to have [docker](https://www.docker.com) installed on your system

Create a file in a directory of your choice called ```docker-compose.yml```

Paste this into that file:

```
services:
  mongo:
    networks:
      - my-network
    image: mongo
    container_name: mongo
    ports:
      - 27017:27017

  mongo-express:
    networks:
      - my-network
    image: mongo-express
    container_name: mongo-express
    ports:
      - 8081:8081
    depends_on:
      - mongo
    restart: always
    environment:
      - ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER=mongo

  api:
    networks:
      - my-network
    image: joehannis/taplist-keg-level-manager:api-latest
    container_name: api-container
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - mongo

  frontend:
    networks:
      - my-network
    image: joehannis/taplist-keg-level-manager:frontend-latest
    container_name: frontend-container
    ports:
      - "4173:4173"
    environment:
      REACT_APP_API_URL: http://api-container:3000
    depends_on:
      - api

networks:
  my-network:
    driver: bridge
```
In your terminal, navigate to the file containing your ```docker-compose.yml``` and run ```docker-compose up -d```

The interface can be accessed at ```http://localhost:4173``` on your local machine or ```<your_ip_address>:4173``` from another device on the network.
